This site was created using RStudio, RMarkdown documents and Github pages. 

#### This is a code chunk:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
##### ^ And this is a tibble.

You can usually ignore code chunks unless you are interested in how we got from a dataset to the final conclusion.

### Reading our findings...

Tibbles are where the information we want lies. You can usually ignore "Setup" and "Cleaning" sections and subheadings. That is when I am going through the data to find what we need from it. Usually, a final analyzed dataset goes from hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows down to a final 50. 

Check at the end of the page for any conclusions or verifications of analyses or data we've looked through.

Enjoy!
